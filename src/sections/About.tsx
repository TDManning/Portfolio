      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">About Me</h2>
      <p className="mt-2">My path to software development was not linear, but curiosity and a passion for problem-solving have always guided me. From teaching to logistics to leadership, I have thrived in fast-paced environments where adaptability and collaboration are key. Whether I was optimizing freight dispatch at Amazon or leading volunteer initiatives, I found joy in creating efficient solutions. That same problem-solving mindset led me to software development, where I could channel my love for problem-solving into building clean, user-focused applications.
Wanting an intellectual challenge that would push me to grow, I enrolled in Turing School of Software & Design, the only accredited, non-profit, online software engineering school with a program lasting under a year. Spending 70 to 80 hours a week building applications both independently and in teams, I strengthened my ability to break down complex problems, adapt quickly, and figure things out even when I did not have all the answers at first. The experience deepened my love for problem-solving, reinforcing my ability to approach unique problems with creativity, persistence, and a keen eye for detail. In software development Iâ€™ve finally found a career wherein I can continue to learn and grow.
At the core of everything I do is a people-first mindset. Whether I am collaborating with a team, mentoring others, or building software, I believe that strong relationships and clear communication drive the best outcomes.
When I am not coding, you will find me pushing myself through movement and fitness, playing my cello, chasing my three kids, or geeking out over a new tech challenge. I thrive in environments that value innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning, and I am excited to bring that energy to my next opportunity.
